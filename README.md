# ladderz

The `ladderz` project is a collection of implementations of mathematical/technical concepts in code. A primary aim is to learn to implement these concepts, regardless of the efficiency of the implementations.

> If you're looking for a more efficient implementation of a concept (e.g., for use in your programs), other resources may be more useful.

You may find the following primary resources:

-   **[notebooks](notebooks)** - Jupyter notebooks with exercises and solutions in Python
    -   [**pre-algebra**](notebooks/pre-algebra) - Pre-algebra concepts
-   **[ladderz](ladderz)** - A crate with implementations of concepts in a Rust library
    -   **[docs](https://rzmk.github.io/ladderz/)** - Documentation for the `ladderz` crate

## Ideas

Not currently implemented, but ideas that may be useful:

-   Extend to:
    -   Algebra
    -   Precalculus
    -   Calculus
    -   Linear Algebra
    -   Statistics
    -   Discrete Math
    -   Algorithms
-   **py-ladderz** - A package for running implementations of mathematical concepts in Python
-   **ladderz CLI** - A CLI tool for ladderz in Rust
-   **ladderz App** - An interactive multi-platform (web, desktop, mobile) app potentially including visualizations, practice problems, & a course-like structure (potentially in Flutter or Tauri with Next.js & Rust)
