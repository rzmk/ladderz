# ladderz

> This is a non-production repository and is for learning to implement concepts in code.

The `ladderz` project is based on content from courses, primarily mathematical/technical concepts.

You may find the following primary resources:

-   **[notebooks](notebooks)** - Jupyter notebooks with exercises and solutions in Python
    -   [**pre-algebra**](notebooks/pre-algebra) - Pre-algebra concepts
-   **[ladderz](ladderz)** - A crate with implementations of concepts in a Rust library

> The repository is not required to have the most efficient implementations, but rather learning to implement the concepts in code is a main endeavor. You may prefer other repositories for more efficient code & use cases.

## Ideas

Not currently implemented, but ideas that may be useful:

-   **py-ladderz** - A package for running implementations of mathematical concepts in Python
-   **ladderz CLI** - A CLI tool for ladderz in Rust
-   **ladderz App** - An interactive multi-platform (web, desktop, mobile) app potentially including visualizations, practice problems, & a course-like structure (potentially in Flutter or Tauri with Next.js & Rust)
